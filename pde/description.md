# solving biharmonic equation on deformed cube

- the goal is to solve the biharmonic equation on a cube

- note that a cube is topologically a sphere

- we can start by solving the biharmonic equation on a rounded cube, and then take the limit

- to start, we'll solve the Laplacian on a rounded cube
