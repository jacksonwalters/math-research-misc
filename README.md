- free algebra quotient: Attempt to construct \C[S_n] as a quotient of the noncommutative polynomial algebra \C<x,y>/I where I is ideal of relations for symmetric group
- Fock space: Calculations involving the infinite dimensional Fock space associated to the symmetric group in Sage.
- roots of unity: Rust code to compute roots of unity in finite field, Chinese remainder theorem.
