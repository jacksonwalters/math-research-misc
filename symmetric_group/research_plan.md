# research plan for symmetric group

## journal submissions

- submitted "The Modular and Unitary DFT of the Symmetric Group" to JoAC [https://link.springer.com/journal/10801]
- may want to submit to "Algebraic Combinatorics" as it would be more on topic there [https://alco.centre-mersenne.org]

## actions

- induced representations: code does not exist yet
- restriction representation: code does not exist yet
- construct the product of two representations: code does not exist yet

## status

- generated reasonable code for InducedRepresenation
- ensure it's passing basic checks, add all tests and examples
